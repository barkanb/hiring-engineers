These are the answers and the proceedures to accomplish all of the tasks provided in the 'hiring-engineers' excersize. 

## The Exercise

The answers will be provided as if they are presented as a guide to a client. It will be strcutured with implementation steps and notes. 
I will also add "developer" notes that should be considered outside of the customer scope and they are intended for Datadog reviers.

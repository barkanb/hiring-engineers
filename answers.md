These are the answers and the proceedures to accomplish all of the tasks provided in the 'hiring-engineers' excersize. 

## The Exercise

The answers will be provided as if they are presented as a guide to a client. It will be strcutured with implementation steps and notes. 
I will also add "developer" notes that should be considered outside of the customer scope and they are intended for Datadog reviers. 

## Prerequisites 

* For the following instructions Ubuntu running on Vagrant was used. 

	```
	Linux vagrant 4.15.0-58-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 6 11:12:41 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
	```

	```

	DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS"
	NAME="Ubuntu"

	ID=ubuntu
	ID_LIKE=debian

	```

* For integration purposes MySQL was installed on the OS. 

	```
	mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.30, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
	```

* Also make sure that you have an active account with [Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com/). 

## Installing the agent on the OS

* Instructions are provided in the [Datadog portal](https://app.datadoghq.com/)

<img src="https://github.com/barkanb/hiring-engineers/blob/master/Images/agent-2.png" width="80%" height="80%"></a>

1. One line install: 

	```
	DD_AGENT_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DD_API_KEY=8c550767f7a781935fcd14dac889d7dc bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/cmd/agent/install_script.sh)"
	```

	The portal will provide a command that will incoporate the right API key. 

2. Make sure that the agent was installed correctly and the following message is displayed: 

	```
	Your Agent is running and functioning properly. It will continue to run in the
	background and submit metrics to Datadog.
	```

3. To check the status of the agent please run the following: 

	```
	sudo service datadog-agent status
	```

	Response: 
	```
		‚óè datadog-agent.service - Datadog Agent
	   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/datadog-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
	   Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-06-19 00:04:16 UTC; 3min 23s ago
	 Main PID: 2344 (agent)
	    Tasks: 9 (limit: 1109)
           ```

4. The machine should appear in the portal's main page and the host map:

## Collecting Metrics- Adding Tags:

1. Adding tags to the Agent can be done through the config file at /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml. 
	The file will include the API key and can hold other relavant tags. 
	I have designated a hostname and added an 'anviorment' and 'machineGourp' tags.  

	```
	hostname: BorisMachine

	tags:
 	  - environment:sales-env
 	  - machineGroup:boris1
	```

	<img src="https://github.com/barkanb/hiring-engineers/blob/master/Images/agent-5.png" width="50%" height="50%"></a>


	- Yaml files are extremly sensitive to syntax and stracture issues, it is recomanded to back up the file before changing or adding anything to it. 
	
2. Restart the agent service.

	```
	sudo service datadog-agent restart
	```

3. Make sure that the new information is provided in the host map.

## Collecting Metrics- MySQL Integration: 

* Follow the instructions on the portal to integrate with MySQL. 
  The instructions bellow are for MySQL 8.0+, for other version please refer to the portal for instructions. 

1. Create a user with proper permissions to be used by the agent. 
	* Make sure the agent is installed and running on the machine. 

	```
	mysql> CREATE USER 'datadog'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password by '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
	```

2. Verify user creation with the following commands:

	```
	mysql> SELECT User FROM mysql.user
	    -> ;
	+------------------+
	| User             |
	+------------------+
	| datadog          |
	| debian-sys-maint |
	| mysql.session    |
	| mysql.sys        |
	| root             |
	+------------------+
	``` 

	```
	mysql -u datadog --password=<UNIQUEPASSWORD> -e "show status" | \
	grep Uptime && echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL user - OK\033[0m" || \
	echo -e "\033[0;31mCannot connect to MySQL\033[0m"
	```

	```
	mysql -u datadog --password=<UNIQUEPASSWORD> -e "show slave status" && \
	echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL grant - OK\033[0m" || \
	echo -e "\033[0;31mMissing REPLICATION CLIENT grant\033[0m"
	```
3. Grant the user more limited privileges:

	```
	mysql> GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
	Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

	mysql> GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost';
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
	```

	```
	mysql> ALTER USER 'datadog'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
	```

4. If enabled, metrics can be collected from the performance_schema database by granting an additional privilege:

	```
	mysql> show databases like 'performance_schema';
	+-------------------------------+
	| Database (performance_schema) |
	+-------------------------------+
	| performance_schema            |
	+-------------------------------+
	1 row in set (0.00 sec)

	mysql> GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost';
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
	```

5. Configure the agent to collect and send data with a yaml configuration file at /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mysql.d/conf.yaml

	```
	init_config:

	instances:
	  - server: 127.0.0.1
	    user: datadog
	    pass: "<YOUR_CHOSEN_PASSWORD>" # from the CREATE USER step earlier
	    port: "<YOUR_MYSQL_PORT>" # e.g. 3306
	    options:
	      replication: false
	      galera_cluster: true
	      extra_status_metrics: true
	      extra_innodb_metrics: true
	      extra_performance_metrics: true
	      schema_size_metrics: false
      	  disable_innodb_metrics: false
	```
